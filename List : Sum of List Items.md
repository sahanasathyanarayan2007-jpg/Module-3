# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = sum(numbers)

print("Sum of elements:", total)
```

## Output
Sum of elements: 150

## Result
Thus, the Python program successfully calculates and prints the sum of all elements in the given list using the built-in sum() function.
